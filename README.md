Welcome to the Histopathology Image Retrieval project! This repository contains code and resources for implementing an image retrieval model using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) image encoder as the backbone. Our goal in this project is to create a robust system that can retrieve relevant histopathology images based on user queries, leveraging the powerful CLIP model.

## Project Description

In the Histopathology Image Retrieval project, we utilize the CLIP image encoder as the backbone of our image retrieval model. CLIP is a state-of-the-art model that has shown remarkable capabilities in understanding the relationships between images and text. By using CLIP, we aim to significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved histopathology images.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the following datasets:

1. **BRACS Dataset**
   - Website: [BRACS Dataset](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/)
   - Description: The BRACS dataset contains a comprehensive collection of histopathology images spanning various tissue types. It is a valuable resource for training and evaluating our image retrieval model.

2. **CRC Dataset**
   - Website: [CRC Dataset](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/extended_crc_grading/)
   - Description: The CRC dataset provides histopathology images related to colorectal cancer. These images contribute to the diversity of the training data and help in building a robust retrieval system.

3. **BATCH Dataset**
   - Website: [BATCH Dataset](https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/)
   - Description: The BATCH dataset is part of the ICAR 2018 challenge and contains histopathology images for various tasks. It serves as an additional resource for validating and testing our retrieval model.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/histopathology-retrieval.git
cd histopathology-retrieval
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the histopathology image retrieval model:

1. Preprocess the datasets: Implement preprocessing scripts to prepare the datasets for training and evaluation.

2. Train the model: Run training scripts to train the image retrieval model using the CLIP image encoder and the prepared datasets.

3. Evaluate the model: Use evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the model on validation and test datasets.

4. Run retrieval: Implement retrieval scripts that take user queries as input and retrieve relevant histopathology images.

## Model Architecture

Our image retrieval model is built upon the CLIP image encoder. CLIP utilizes a contrastive learning approach to map images and text into a shared embedding space, enabling the model to understand the semantic relationships between images and textual descriptions.

## Results

We expect to achieve significant improvements in histopathology image retrieval accuracy by leveraging the CLIP image encoder. Detailed performance metrics and comparisons with existing methods will be available in our [results document](results.md).
